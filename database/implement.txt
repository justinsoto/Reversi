README: THE SCHEMA ONLY NEEDS TO BE RUN ONE SINGLE TIME -- I JUST DID IT FROM MYSQL SERVER

RAN: 
    CREATE DATABASE my_database;
    CREATE USER 'my_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'my_password';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON my_database.* TO 'my_user'@'localhost';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

THEN JUST COPIED THE SCHEMA AND RAN THAT TOO



from mysql.connector import connect, Error
from getpass import getpass
from model.db_management.user_manager import UserManager
from model.db_management.games_manager import GamesManager
from model.db_management.ratings_manager import RatingsManager
from model.db_management.leaderboard_manager import LeaderboardManager

EXAMPLE OF CONNECTING AND SETTING UP MANAGERS:

try:
        connection = connect(
            host ='localhost',
            user = input('Enter Username: '),
            password = getpass('Enter Pasword: '),
            database="Othello" 
        )
    
    #can probaly pass these managers or the connection itself
    user_manager = UserManager(connection)

    games_manager = GamesManager(connection)

    ratings_manager = RatingsManager(connection)

    leaderboard_manager = LeaderboardManager(connection)

except Error as err:
    print("Error:", err)

finally:
    connection.close()
